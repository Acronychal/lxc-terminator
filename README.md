# Proxmox VE lxc-terminator
Adapted from onemarcfifty's ansible-rundeck repository. Pleas check out his work on youtube and github. 

This script runs on a fresh Debian 11 LXC install in Proxmox.

I outfited this script with a couple of prompts to set user and password. I also added xfce4 desktop environment and other rdp packages for easy remote access. I am using this lxc container to learn about Ansible using rundeck to manage my Proxmox VE sandbox.


## To Do
